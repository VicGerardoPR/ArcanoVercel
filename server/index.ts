// This file is kept for reference only.
// For production, use Vercel or any static hosting service.
// The project is now configured as a pure static site using Vite.

// If you need to test the production build locally:
// 1. Run: npm run build
// 2. Then use a simple HTTP server like: npx serve dist/public
// 3. Or use Python: python -m http.server --directory dist/public 8000

console.log("This is a static site. Use 'npm run dev' for development or 'npm run build' for production build.");
